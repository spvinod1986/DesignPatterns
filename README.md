# Design Patterns
This project demonstrates common design patterns and object oriented programming principles with examples.

## Behavioral Patterns:
Common communication pattern between objects.
* Chain of Responsibility: 
    - Execute tasks in chain to process a request.
* Memento: 
    - To implement Undo mechanism.
    - Captures an object's internal state and restore if required. 
    - Snapshot history of object is used to restore.
* State: 
    - Object changes behaviour based on internal state.
* Iterator: 
    - Sequentially iterate through object collection using iterator.
* Strategy: 
    - An object can do something specific in different ways.
* Template: 
    - Super class template method defines skeleton of algorithm. 
    - Child classes implement/override specific tasks as required.
